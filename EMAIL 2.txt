Congratulations <name redacted> your new job, I had to verify 
all the information you provided. I hope to have your 100% loyalty and 
co-operation. Your quick response to e-mails and effectiveness will be 
required and you will be receiving your first assignment very soon. 
 
You will be emailed with detailed instructions. After checking my 
programs, unfortunately, you donâ€™t have much done for me this week. So, 
you'll be starting your first Assignment In few days, I am unable to meet 
up for an interview because I am currently away and helping the disabled 
students in Abroad as stated in my previous email but scheduled to be back 
last week of July 
 
What I would want you to do for me As discussed in my initial email, You 
will begin your job duties which is mailing letters Via USPS FedEx, making 
bill payments and replying emails on my behalf, preparing my accommodation 
off campus upon my arrival, etc, You will also be making a Payment out to 
my Travel Agency as well for my return early next month.My accountant will 
disburse payment across to you tomorrow Morning overnight Courier to

You should be receiving the Payment next day, providing you with the 
Shipment Evidence(Tracking #). The payment will be in the form of a 
certified check mailed to you. Once you receive the Funds, you will take 
your First Salary of $450 from it, after which you'll use the rest in 
carrying out your assignment. Detailed instructions on your first 
assignment will be sent to you once check received and cleared. From this 
point, your maximum attention will be required, I will urge you to tighten 
up your relationship with your email. Make sure you check your email 2-3 
times daily and also respond to my emails even if it's just some few words 
or a sentence in order to acknowledge the receipt. 
 
I would feel ignored if I don't get a response to my email. Ensure you 
always check all your Email folders for my messages as some messages do get 
into Bulk/Spam mail folders at times.In accepting my offer of employment, 
you certify your understanding that your employment will start now, and 
that neither you nor I have entered into a contract regarding the terms or 
the duration of your employment until my arrival. 
 
As an at-will employee, you will be free to terminate your employment 
with me at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. Likewise, I 
also, have the right to reassign you or to terminate your employment at any 
time, with or without cause or advance notice if you are not capable of 
carrying out the tasks and assignments assigned to you by me.I will need 
you to acknowledge the receipt of this email with your working Cell Phone 
Number so I can text you for easy and fast communication.
